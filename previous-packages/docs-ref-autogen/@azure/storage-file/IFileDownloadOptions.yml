      How many retries will perform when original body download stream
      unexpected ends.

      Above kind of ends will not trigger retry policy defined in a pipeline,

      because they doesn't emit network errors.

      FileURL.download() request will be made

      downloaded or maxRetryRequests is reached.


      Default value is 5, please set a larger value when loading large files in
