      Video retention period indicates the maximum age of the video archive
      segments which are intended to be kept in storage. It must be provided in
      the ISO8601 duration format in the granularity of days, up to a maximum of
      10 years. For example, if this is set to P30D (30 days), content older
      than 30 days will be periodically deleted. This value can be updated at
      any time and the new desired retention period will be effective within 24
      hours.
