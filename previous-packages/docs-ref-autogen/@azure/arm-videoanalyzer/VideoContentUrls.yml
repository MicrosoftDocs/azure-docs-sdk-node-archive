      Video archive streaming base URL. The archived content can be
      automatically played by the Azure Video Analyzer player widget.
      Alternatively, this URL can be used in conjunction with the video content
      authorization token on any compatible DASH or HLS players by appending the
      following to the base URL:

          - HLSv4:     /manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8
          - HLS CMAF:  /manifest(format=m3u8-cmaf)
          - DASH CMAF: /manifest(format=mpd-time-cmaf)

          Moreover, an ongoing video recording can be played in "live mode" with latencies which are approximately double of the chosen video segment length. It is available when the video type is 'archive' and video archiving is enabled.
