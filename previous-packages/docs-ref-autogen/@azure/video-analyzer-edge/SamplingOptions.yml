      When set to 'true', prevents frames without upstream inference data to be
      sent to the extension plugin. This is useful to limit the frames sent to
      the extension to pre-analyzed frames only. For example, when used
      downstream from a motion detector, this can enable for only frames in
      which motion has been detected to be further analyzed.
